The [Hind Siliguri](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Hind+Siliguri) typeface contains malformed glyphs for Bengali Digit One "à§§" in its regular, medium, and semi-bold weights.
I've fixed these for my personal use and decided to share here until original sources and distributions are updated.

#### Note on sources

original source is here: https://github.com/itfoundry/hind-siliguri
But the build instructions in ITF's repo seems outdated, so I've edited their published TTF files in fontforge, creating the SFD and TTF files available in this repository.
